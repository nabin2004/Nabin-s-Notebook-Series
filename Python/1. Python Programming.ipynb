There are lots of programming languages. Just like lots of tools to cut trees but It totally depends on you or your projects to which tools to choose. You can choose blade to trim beard but not to trees. You can choose axe to cut trees but may be not suitable for cutting beard. Similliarly, There are range of Programming language that you can learn."

But in some cases, Python is considered bad choice, still today also. But if you look there reason, you'll find out that most of alligations that are put on Python are for Python 2 which was predecessor before python 3 and remaining alligations are true :)"

    "Python is a interpreted programming language. What does that mean 'Interpreted'?\\\n",
    "Well, Every programming language has its own Architecture that impacts its speed, efficiency, even syntax sometime. So, If you look at Python. Python has interpreter that converts the code that you have written to C language. And C language is understandable by your computer, which later compiles in machine level langauge 1s and 0s. If you look at this lines closely, You'll notice that Python converts/interprets to C programming language. By the way, that's why Python is called interpreted language. Also, if you reliaze, you'll notice that if I write programming language on C language. It'll far better and what's use of Python then. Well, This question was answered by `Guido Van Russom`, Creator of Python that if programming language are our human language then C language requires focus of How are vocals while speaking that language are and Python focuses on what words are we using. You can think vocals as low level coding and words as abstraction.  "
